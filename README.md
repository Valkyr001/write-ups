This repository contains my write-ups that I have finalized for machines that I compromise. 
It is organized into categories based on the platform that the target machine comes from. (TryHackMe, HackTheBox, etc).
This repo was created with the intention to get feedback and recommendations from anyone who might see it, as well as display my work. 
The format will be different across different reports, as I revise my formatting and and structure considering the feedback I get and after each engagement, but I do not update old reports unless re-assessing that machine.
