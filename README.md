This repository contains of my write-ups that I have finalized for machines that I compromise. 
It is organized into categories based on the platform that the machine comes from. (TryHackMe, HackTheBox, etc).
This repo was created with the intention to get feedback and recommendations from anyone who might see it, as well as display my work.
